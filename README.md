## Install
This tutorial will require recent Python 3.x installation with *numpy*, *scipy*,
*matplotlib*, *scikit-learn*, *seaborn*, *pandas*, *tables*, *pyprind* and *ipython*.

For those who do not have the above packages installed or don't want to bother
with pip, a relatively painless way to install all the requirements is to use
[Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads#py34 "Anaconda"), which can be
downloaded and installed for free.
