## Installation Notes
This tutorial will require recent installations of *numpy*, *scipy*,
*matplotlib*, *scikit-learn*, *seaborn*, *pandas*, *tables*, *pyprind* and *ipython*.
We have provided a bootstrap file that you can use with pip by running:
    pip install -r bootstrap.txt^M

The project also uses Python 3 and is not comptabile with Python 2.x

For those who do not have the above packages installed or don't want to bother
with pip , a relatively painless way to install all the requirements is to use
[Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads "Anaconda"), which can be
downloaded and installed for free.
